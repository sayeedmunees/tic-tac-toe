# Tic Tac Toe (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

A simple, polished Tic‑Tac‑Toe for two players. It uses vanilla JavaScript, rounded white tiles, colored X/O marks, and a blurred overlay that announces the result with a “New Game” button. The game logic is intentionally minimal and beginner‑friendly.

## Demo
- Click any empty tile to place a mark.
- X starts first; turns alternate automatically.
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
- At game end, a blur overlay shows the winner or a draw and offers “New Game”.

## Features
- Clean UI: card‑like tiles, soft shadows, gradient background
- Minimal JS (no frameworks)
- Colored marks: X (violet), O (cyan)
- End‑game overlay created with `innerHTML`
- Restart/New Game resets board and UI
